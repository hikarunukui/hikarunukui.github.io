I am Hikaru Nukui (貫井 光), a Ph.D. student at Graduate School of Political Science, Waseda University. My research interests lie at the intersection of political behavior and comparative political economy, with a particular focus on advanced democracies. I use natural experiments and survey experiments for my research.
